The project uses Simple DirectMedia Layer 2 (SDL2). It is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. Software developers can use it to write high-performance computer games and other multimedia applications that can run on many operating system. SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings available for several other languages, including C# and Python.
